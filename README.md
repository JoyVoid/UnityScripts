# UnityScripts
Scripts to control some game objects

HoldBall.cs
      -> When this script is attached to a GameObject, the Collider object that it hits will have its position transformed as the same as the GameObjects Position
         *Note that the collided object can be hidden since it is transformed as same coordinates.
      -> Commented out portion transforms position to directly above GameObject rather than it's own coordinates.
